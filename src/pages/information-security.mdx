# Information Security

Why is there a dedicated "Section" for information security?

As a software developer, my responsibility involves sharing information appropriately with the right individuals, groups, or systems, while ensuring that no unauthorized access occurs under any circumstances.

While it's relatively straightforward to create software that serves its intended purpose (the "happy path"), even novice developers can often find solutions through online resources. However, recognizing when a seemingly functional "solution" poses risks demands a deeper understanding and a trained perspective.

Just reading the OWASP Top 10 once a year isn't sufficient. The examples are helpful, but as developers we should be trying to exploit these vulnerabilities ourselves. This is the only way, we can genuinely grasp the type of vulnerabilities we're aiming to avoid unintentionally incorporating into our software.

Grasping the potential risks tied to the software I build enables me to avoid common errors that developers frequently make. It also empowers me to address vulnerabilities promptly, sometimes even before a vulnerable library gets fixed.
