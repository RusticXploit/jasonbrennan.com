I just need a place to keep my notes on a semi frequent basis. 

## And that means:

* This isn't going to be pretty; at least not yet.
* A post is a point in time reference.
* This isn't a collection of "Tutorials" that explain, start to finish, how to complete a task.
* Not everything is going to be "correct"; I will do, spell, and explain things wrong as I learn new things.
* I likely wont fix an error in the "post" but if it's "that bad" I'll try to add some notes.

### And lastly:

* I am making this for me, not you.

That being said, constructive criticism is always welcome.
